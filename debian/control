Description: Compression and decompression in the LZMA format - command line utility
 The Lempel-Ziv Markov-chain Algorithm is a compression method based on
 the famous LZ77 algorithm, and was first introduced by 7-Zip for use in
 7z archives.
 .
 Its main characteristics are a very high compression ratio, with high RAM
 usage, and fast decompression, with low RAM usage. These properties make
 it well suited to embedded uses, such as for ROM (firmware) compression.
 .
 This package provides the lzma command line utility, which has a
 familiar gzip-like interface.

Description: Compression and decompression in the LZMA format - legacy utility
 The Lempel-Ziv Markov-chain Algorithm is a compression method based on
 the famous LZ77 algorithm, and was first introduced by 7-Zip for use in
 7z archives.
 .
 Its main characteristics are a very high compression ratio, with high RAM
 usage, and fast decompression, with low RAM usage. These properties make
 it well suited to embedded uses, such as for ROM (firmware) compression.
 .
 This package provides only the old lzma_alone compression utility, which
 has an interface more like that of zip.

Description: Compression and decompression in the LZMA format - development files
 The Lempel-Ziv Markov-chain Algorithm is a compression method based on
 the famous LZ77 algorithm, and was first introduced by 7-Zip for use in
 7z archives.

 Its main characteristics are a very high compression ratio, with high RAM
 usage, and fast decompression, with low RAM usage. These properties make

 .
 This package contains the headers and libraries of lzma. It is
 experimental and will be replaced by the library as soon as it is
 available.
